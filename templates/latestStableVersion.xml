        <li>The plugin's upgrade prompt now includes a link to the release notes. (The upgrade prompt is the popup window which invites you to install the latest version of the plugin.)</li>
        <li>The upgrade now allows a different version-numbering pattern, to allow for 'alpha' and 'beta' releases.</ul>]]></versionReleaseNotes>
