        <p>
        With pleasure, Atlassian presents the Atlassian IntelliJ Connector 2.0.
        Over the past weeks, we have been working on the IntelliJ Connector and issuing regular beta releases. Now we are proud to release the final version 2.0.
        </p>
        <p>
        The connector now offers the same look and feel for JIRA issues, Bamboo builds and Crucible reviews.
        The connector's windows all open as IDEA tool windows, appearing by default at the bottom of your IDE. Take a look at the release notes, to see the new things you can do with issues, builds and reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can open a FishEye view directly from a file in the IDEA editor, or open files in IDEA by supplying a FishEye URL.
        There is a new FishEye-only connection for those who do not have a Crucible server.
        </p>
        <p>
        Share your server connections across your project team while retaining your own IDE settings. The connector is now also compatible with IntelliJ IDEA 8.
        </p>
