The Atlassian Connector for Microsot Visual Studio is an Vsual Studio Add-in that lets you work<br>
with the Atlassian products within your IDE. Now you don't have to switch between websites,<br>
email messages and news feeds to see what's happening to your project and your code.<br>
Instead, you can see the relevant <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a> issues, 
<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/">Crucible</a> reviews and <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/">Bamboo</a><br>
build information right there in your development environment. Viewing your code in <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/">FishEye</a><br> 
is just a click away.

Developed by Atlassian for you to lust after
