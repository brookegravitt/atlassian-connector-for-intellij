        <p>
        With pleasure, Atlassian presents version <b>2.0 Beta 9</b> of the Atlassian IntelliJ Connector.
		In this iteration we have focused on the new connector's Reviews tab. Your Crucible filters are shown in a tree structure on the left of the tab,
		with the reviews for the selected filter shown on the right.
        </p>
        <p>You can now <b>group the reviews by author, state, project and server </b>. In the heading for each group, the connector displays the number of reviews in the group.
        </p>

        <p>The custom filter dialogue box is now much prettier and easier to use.</p>
