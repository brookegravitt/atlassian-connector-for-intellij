        <p>
        Latest stable version of Atlassian Connector for IntelliJ IDEA is 2.2.1
        </p>
        <p>
        We have released this version of the IntelliJ Connector before IDEA 9.0 has been released. Therefore we have managed to perform only a limited number of tests on this IDEA version, as "early access preview" builds are not stable enough for intensive testing.
